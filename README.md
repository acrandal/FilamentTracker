# FilamentTracker

A simple device to sit on top of a Creality Ender 3 Pro and guesstimate the amounf of filament left on the spool using a range finder.

Based around the ESP8266, Lolin OLED shield, and a protoshield with two buttons to set/reset the min/max ranges of full spools.

The 3D model compression fits onto the top bar of the 3D printer - no need for bolts there.
